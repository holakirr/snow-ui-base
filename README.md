# Holakirr Snow UI

SnowUI is a React UI of mostly (!) "stupid" (with no state or effect, you'll have to provide it by yourself) components library implementation of [SnowUI design kit](https://snowui.byewind.com) by [ByeWind](https://byewind.com/). Implemented and improved by [holakirr](https://github.com/holakirr). Based on TailwindCSS.
